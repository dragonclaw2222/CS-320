How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Going forward in my coding to ensure I have functional and secure work I will continue to reiterate on my code through repetition to hopefully iron out any discrepancies or issues I may have missed previously.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are always considered as that is the end goal of most projects making sure everything is functional with as little room for errors or unforeseen issues as possible to provide the most effective and workable product at the end of a project

How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to try to follow the guidelines of the project as closely as possible while expanding my knowledge of the functions and then going back and reworking and improving as my knowledge and functional skills grow.# CS-320
